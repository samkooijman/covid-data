This document describes the contents of the weather per region in USA. The variable names described below refer to column names. The data is fetched by using an API of WorldWeatherOnline. This API is free for 60 days and limited to 500 calls per day. 


Data sources:
â€¢ WorldWeatherOnline

--------------------------------------------------
General description:
The CSV files retrieved through the API can be used for the KPIs related to this.
In the API, the developer can specify from which date the desired data must be retrieved.
The data can therefore be retrieved historically for the countries that have been selected.
At this moment we have chosen to save the retrieved data in CSV files. 
The column "season" is missing from the API.
It will be created manually during the transformation of the data.
