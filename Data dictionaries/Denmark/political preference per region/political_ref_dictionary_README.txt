General description:
In Danish elections votes are counted manually. The municipalities use an IT-system developed by KMD afterwards. It is only a few very obvious mistakes that Statistics Denmark has any possibility of discovering. E.g. when a result in one area differs significantly from other results within the same constituency. Controls are in place in order to find situations like these.
Data is fully filled. No major concerns about compatibility with data types.
